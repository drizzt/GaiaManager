  <h2><a id="usage">usage</a></h2>

  <p>You just need to put your game in <strong>/dev_hdd0/BDRIPS</strong> via FTP or <strong>BDRIPS</strong> in the root of a FAT32 formatted USB disk, you can change the games directory compiling with <code>make WITH_GAMES_DIR=<em>XXX</em></code><br />
  And your games cover (260x300) in <strong>/dev_hdd0/BDCOVERS</strong> or <strong>BDCOVERS</strong> in the root of the USB disk that contains the game as <strong>TITLEID.PNG</strong> (for example <strong>BLES12345.PNG</strong>).</p>

  <h2><a id="features">features</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Supports up to 512 items from two USB devices, internal hdd and bluray</li>

    <li>Ability to copy games from bdvd to hdd0 or USB's, from hdd0 to USB's or from USB's to hdd0. It is done asking to you the destination device. It use uses asynchronous reading and writing for fast copy.</li>

    <li>Special support for big files in FAT: it splits files &gt;= 4GB using .666xx fragments (if the file is name.ext, the file splits as name.ext.66600, name.ext.66601,...). This file is not bootable and it is marked using '_' as folder prefix. The file is joined when you copy it to hdd0 device</li>

    <li>Automatically finds the path of the games and asks to you about it. In other case, if the Gaia Manager is installed in the hdd0 creates one. You can change it pressing <strong>SELECT+START</strong> later.</li>

    <li>Including checking game option (pressing <strong>R3</strong>). It displays information about the files, size, splits or big files, if it have one.</li>

    <li>Support for Homebrew: you can creates "homebrew" folder in root USB FAT device and put here others folders with an EBOOT.BIN (.self format) and one ICON0.PNG. Also you can use the internal hdd0. Homebrew is launched directly and receive the path in argv[0].</li>

    <li>FTP support to upload homebrew: Gaia Manager uses "<strong>GAIA01985</strong>" as user, by default. I recommend flashfxp to use it, because FTP (Sony) support is not very good...</li>

    <li>Supports Hermes v3 patching and disc-less playing. if you return from game list, apps_home can launch games without one disc (some games don't work without any disc)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a id="payloads">supported payloads</a></h2>

  <p>To have all the features (including retail game patching) you have to use one of the following payloads:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>PSGroove Hermes V4 <a href="http://www.elotrolado.net/hilo_desarrollo-psgroove-payload-custom-v4_1490355">from elotrolado</a></li>

    <li>PSGroove Hermes V3 + Patch Waninkoko + 2 Fix Update Math <a href="http://psx-scene.com/forums/554617-post1.html">from PSX-Scene.com</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://github.com/kakaroto/psgroove">KaKaRoTo's PSGroove</a> fork with PL3 support</li>

    <li><a href="http://psfreedom.com/">PSFreedom</a> with new <a href="http://github.com/kakaroto/pl3">pl3</a>, such as <a href="http://psfmod.klutsh.com/">psfMOD</a> 0.9.6.0 or newer</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Old payloads still work but without all the features supported by Gaia Manager</p>

  <h2><a id="source">source code</a></h2>

  <p>You can compile it with Sony&copy; leaked SDK 1.92 using <a href="http://github.com/drizztbsd/GaiaManager">my github repository</a><br />
  I use <strong>git submodules</strong>, so you need to do <code>git submodule update --init</code> after the first clone (and when I update a submodule)</p>

  <h2><a id="binaries">binaries</a></h2>

  <p>I can't distribute binaries, since I'm not allowed to use the Sony&copy; leaked SDK.<br />
  You have to compile by yourself or you can try to find precompiled binaries using <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>
